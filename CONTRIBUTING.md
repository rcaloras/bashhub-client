# Contributing to Bashhub
Thanks for contributing to Bashhub! This file outlines several best practices when trying to develop and contribute to the repo.

## Pull Requests
Simple changes can be submitted directly as PRs against Master. Major pull requests and new features should be submitted against the current development branch. Checkout a copy of the next version which is postfixed with `-dev`.
The latest development version can be found on https://github.com/rcaloras/bashhub-client/branches.

## Dev Environment Setup
You should be able to develop and execute Bashhub's client locally as well as run its unit tests. This typically involves cloning the repo and setting up a virtualenv to develop with. 
Bashhub is currently setup as Python 2 project built with setuptools.

```bash
# setup and clone our repo locally
mkdir ~/git/ && cd ~/git
git clone git@github.com:rcaloras/bashhub-client.git
cd ~/git/bashhub-client
```
Setup a new Python 3 [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (virtual environment). 
```bash
# Setup a venv.
python3 -m venv .venv
# Activate the venv.
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install our project locally to develop, execute, and test against.
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

This should setup the project locally. Output should look something like:
```bash
[rcaloras:~/git/bashhub-client] [bashhub_dev] master ± pip install -e ".[test]"

```
From within this virtualenv `bh` and `bashhub` exectuables should now be wired up for development. You should also be able to run pytest (you may have to start a new terminal session).

```bash
# bashhub and bh exectuables point to our current dev env
[rcaloras:~/git/bashhub-client] [bashhub_dev] master ± which bashhub
/Users/rcaloras/Envs/bashhub_dev/bin/bashhub
[rcaloras:~/git/bashhub-client] [bashhub_dev] master ± which bh
/Users/rcaloras/Envs/bashhub_dev/bin/bh

# pytest should run locally against our repo
[rcaloras:~/git/bashhub-client] [bashhub_dev] master ± pytest
